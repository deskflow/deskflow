# GUI Config

 The search order for a setting file is:
 1. `<install-path>/settings/Deskflow.conf`
 1. `<XDG_CONFIG_HOME>/Deskflow/Deskflow.conf`
 1. A user settings file
 1. A system settings file
 
 A new settings file will be created in the user path if no settings file is found.
 The path of the settings file will be used as the base for all other config files.
 
### Windows
 - System: `C:\ProgramData\Deskflow\Deskflow.conf`
 - User: `C:\Users\userName\AppData\Local\Deskflow\Deskflow.conf`
 
### Linux
 - System: `/etc/Deskflow/Deskflow.conf`
 - User: `~/.config/Deskflow/Deskflow.conf`
 
### macOS
 - System: `/Library/Deskflow/Deskflow.conf`
 - User: `~/Library/Deskflow/Deskflow.conf`

# Server Config Examples

The `deskflow-server` command accepts the `-c` or `--config` option, which takes one argument,
the path to a server configuration file. The format is non-standard but similar to YAML.

Comments begin with the `#` character and continue to the end of line.
Comments may appear anywhere the syntax permits.

Each `section` element must have a matching `end` element.

## Stacked Example

Stack one computer's screen on top of another's.

```
#           +-------+
#           | curly |
#           |       |
#           +-------+
# +-------+ +-------+
# | moe   | | larry |
# |       | |       |
# +-------+ +-------+

section: screens
	# three hosts named: moe, larry, and curly
	moe:
	larry:
	curly:
end

section: links
	# larry is to the right of moe and curly is above moe.
	moe:
		right = larry
		up    = curly

	# moe is to the left of larry and curly is above larry.
	larry:
		left  = moe
		up    = curly

	# larry is below curly.
	curly:
		down  = larry
end

section: aliases
	# curly is also known as shemp
	curly:
		shemp
end
```

## Horizontal Example

Align all screens horizontally.

```
# +-------+ +-------+ +-------+
# | moe   | | larry | | curly |
# |       | |       | |       |
# +-------+ +-------+ +-------+

section: screens
	# three hosts named: moe, larry, and curly
	moe:
	larry:
	curly:
end

section: links
	# curly is to the right of larry and moe is to the left of larry.
	larry:
		right = curly
		left  = moe

	# larry is to the right of moe.
	moe:
		right = larry

	# larry is to the left of curly.
	curly:
		left  = larry
end

```

## Span Example

Span two screens on one computer across the screens of two computers.

```
# +-------+ +-------+
# | curly | | curly |
# |       | |       |
# +-------+ +-------+
# +-------+ +-------+
# | moe   | | larry |
# |       | |       |
# +-------+ +-------+

section: screens
	# three hosts named: moe, larry, and curly
	moe:
	larry:
	curly:
end

section: links
	# larry is to the right of moe and curly is above moe.
	moe:
		right = larry
		up    = curly

	# moe is to the left of larry and curly is above larry.
	larry:
		left  = moe
		up    = curly

	# larry is below curly.
	curly:
		down  = larry
end
```

# Example file for `--config-toml` arg

```
[server.args]
no-daemon = true
no-tray = true
debug = "DEBUG"
name = "moe"
address = ":24800"

[client.args]
no-daemon = true
no-tray = true
debug = "DEBUG2"
name = "larry"
_last = "moe:24800"
```


# Example  `.env` file


```
#
# App
#

# Shows the test menu in the GUI (on by default in debug mode)
# DESKFLOW_TEST_MENU=true

# Version checker URL to use (useful for testing)
# DESKFLOW_VERSION_URL="https://api.deskflow.org/version?fake=1.100.0"

# Enable debug logging in the GUI (on by default in debug mode)
# DESKFLOW_GUI_DEBUG=true
