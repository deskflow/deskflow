# Building Deskflow

To build Deskflow you will a minimum of: 
    - [cmake] 3.24+
    - [Qt] 6.7.0+
    - [openssl] 3.0+
    - [libportal] 0.8+ (linux, bsd)
    - [libei] 1.3+ (linux, bsd)
    - [google_test] ^
    - [cli11] ^

> ^ Will be fetched if not found on the host system.

By default a build of Deskflow will: 
     - The GUI application deskflow
     - The Core application deskflow-core
     - Documentation if [doxygen] was found on your system
     - Tests that will be run as part of the build process.

## Configuration
Deskflow supports the following build options

CMake options:
|         Option           |            Description                  |   Default Value    | Additional requirements |
:-------------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|:------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| BUILD_GUI                | Build GUI                               | ON                 | |
| BUILD_USER_DOCS          | Build user documentation                | DOXYGEN_FOUND      | `Doxygen` |
| BUILD_DEV_DOCS           | Build development documentation         | OFF                | `Doxygen` |
| BUILD_INSTALLER          | Build installers/packages               | ON                 | |
| BUILD_TESTS              | Build unit tests and legacy tests       | ON                 | `gtest`|
| ENABLE_COVERAGE          | Enable test coverage                    | OFF                | `gcov` |
| SKIP_BUILD_TESTS         | Skip running of tests at build time     | OFF                | |
| VCPKG_QT                 | Build Qt w/ vcpkg (windows only)        | OFF                | |

Example cmake configuration.
`cmake -S. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<INSTALLPREFIX>`

### Windows Configuration
 It is recommended to use vcpkg to install the dependencies. The first time you configure Deskflow, all dependencies other than Qt will be built. If you don't want to use vcpkg, you must manually setup the dependencies. However, that will not be covered by this document.
 
#### Windows and Qt
 There are two ways you can install [Qt] on Windows (vcpkg or Qt online installer). The default configuration expects you to use the Qt online installer. You should not install Qt in both ways, as having both can cause some weird things to happen, like Qt getting libs from one install and plugins from the other. When switching between them, remove the previous install first.
 
##### System Qt

 1. Download and install the [Qt] online installer from their website.
 2. Add the path of Qt's cmake files to your system path. (Skipping this may require you provide this path to cmake via `Qt6_DIR` at configure time)
   - Often `C:\Qt\<version>\<msvcinfo>\lib\cmake`
 3. Add the path of Qt's binary tools to your system path.
   - Often `C:\Qt\<version>\<msvcinfo>\bin`

##### Vcpkg managed Qt
 1. Add the option `-DVCPKG_QT=ON` to your cmake configuration command (i.e `cmake -S. -Bbuild -DVCPKG_QT=ON ...`) or if using an IDE, look for the option where you configure the project, have the IDE run cmake again.
 2. Once the configuration starts, you should see a lot more packages vcpkg will build. Building Qt takes a long time (potentially hours), so go find something else to do for a while.
 3. If you want to use the system Qt again, you must delete the `vcpkg.json` generated in the project root and the `build` folder and reconfigure the project from scratch.

## Build
After configuring you should be able to run make to build all targets.

`cmake --build build`

## Install
 To test installation run `DESTDIR=<installDIR> cmake --install build` to install into `<installDir>/<CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>` <br>
 Running `cmake --install build` will install to the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`

## Making Deskflow packages
 Deskflow can generate several packages using cpack.
 To generate packages build the `package` or `package_source` target.
 Example: ` cmake --build build --target package package_source` would generate both package and package source packages.
 Deskflow can generate several package types depending on the system. Archive-based packages should work on all platforms. On Linux deb and rpm info is set up, flatpaks can be generated from the included file in deploy/linux and a PKGBUILD for Arch linux is generated in the build folder. On macos a dmg file will be created and signed. For windows wix can be used to create an installer.
