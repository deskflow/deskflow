<h4>Answers</h4>
<ol class="faq">
<li><a name="faq1"></a><span class="fakelink">Why doesn't ctrl+alt+del work on secondary screens?</span>
<p>
    Synergy isn't able to capture ctrl+alt+del on PC compatible
    systems because it's handled completely differently than
    other keystrokes.  However, when the mouse is on a client
    screen, pressing ctrl+alt+pause will simulate ctrl+alt+del
    on the client.  (A client running on Windows NT, 2000, or XP
    must be configured to autostart when the computer starts for
    this to work.)
</p>

<li><a name="faq2"></a><span class="fakelink">Can the server and client be using different operating systems?</span>
<p>
    Yes.  The synergy network protocol is platform neutral so
    synergy doesn't care what operating systems are running on
    the server and clients.
</p>

<li><a name="faq3"></a><span class="fakelink">What's the difference between synergy and
<span class="code">x2x</span>, <span class="code">x2vnc</span>, etc?</span>
<p>
    Unlike <span class="code">x2x</span>, synergy supports any number of computers and
    it doesn't require X on Microsoft Windows platforms.  It
    also has more advanced clipboard support and synchronizes
    screensavers.  <span class="code">x2vnc</span> is also limited to two computers,
    requires the separate vnc package, and is really only
    appropriate for using an X system to control a non-X system.
    However, the right tool for the job is whatever tool works
    best for you.
</p>

<li><a name="faq4"></a><span class="fakelink">What does "Cannot initialize hook library" mean?</span>
<p>
    This error can occur on a synergy server running on a
    Microsoft Windows operating system.  It means that synergy
    is already running or possibly was not shut down properly.
    If it's running then first end the synergy task.  If it's
    not then try logging off and back on or rebooting then
    starting synergy again.
</p>

<li><a name="faq5"></a><span class="fakelink">What security/encryption does synergy provide?</span>
<p>
    Synergy provides no built-in encryption or authentication.
    Given that, synergy should not be used on or over any untrusted
    network, especially the Internet.  It's generally fine for home
    networks.  Future versions may provide built-in encryption and
    authentication.
</p>
<p>
    Strong encryption and authentication is available through SSH
    (secure shell).  Run the SSH daemon (i.e. server) on the same
    computer that you run the synergy server.  It requires no
    special configuration to support synergy.  On each synergy
    client system, run SSH with port forwarding:
</p>
<pre>
        ssh -f -N -L 24800:<span class="arg">server-hostname</span>:24800 <span class="arg">server-hostname</span>
</pre>
<p>
    where <span class="arg">server-hostname</span> is the name of the
	SSH/synergy server.
    Once ssh authenticates itself, start the synergy client
    normally except use <span class="code">localhost</span> or 
    <span class="code">127.0.0.1</span> as the server's
    address.  SSH will then encrypt all communication on behalf of
    synergy.  Authentication is handled by the SSH authentication.
</p>
<p>
    A free implementation of SSH for Linux and many Unix systems is
    <a href="http://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a>.  For
    Windows there's a port of OpenSSH using
    <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin<a>.
</p>

<li><a name="faq6"></a><span class="fakelink">What should I call my screens in the configuration?</span>
<p>
    You can use any unique name in the configuration file for each
    screen but it's easiest to use the hostname of the computer.
    That's the computer name not including the domain.  For example,
    a computer with the fully qualified domain name <span class="code">xyz.foo.com</span> has
    the hostname <span class="code">xyz</span>.  There should also be an alias for <span class="code">xyz</span> to
    <span class="code">xyz.foo.com</span>.  If you don't use the computer's hostname, you
    have to tell synergy the name of the screen using a command line
    option, or the startup dialog on Windows.
</p>
<p>
    Some systems are configured to report the fully qualified domain
    name as the hostname.  For those systems it will be easier to use
    the FQDN as the screen name.  Also note that a Mac OS X system
    named <span class="code">xyz</span> may report its hostname as
    <span class="code">xyz.local</span>.  If that's the case for you
    then use <span class="code">xyz.local</span> as the screen name.
</p>

<li><a name="faq7"></a><span class="fakelink">Why do my Caps-Lock, Num-Lock, Scroll-Lock keys act funny?</span>
<p>
    Some systems treat the Caps-Lock, Num-Lock, and Scroll-Lock keys
	differently than all the others.  Whereas most keys report going down
	when physically pressed and going up when physically released, on
    these systems the keys report going down when being activated and
	going up when being deactivated.  That is, when you press and release,
	say, Caps-Lock to activate it, it only reports going down, and when
	you press and release to deactivate it, it only reports going up.
	This confuses synergy.
</p>
<p>
    You can solve the problem by changing your configuration file.
    In the screens section, following each screen that has the
    problem, add any or all of these lines as appropriate:
</p>
<pre>
        halfDuplexCapsLock = true
        halfDuplexNumLock = true
        halfDuplexScrollLock = true
</pre>
<p>
    Then restart synergy on the server or reload the configuration.
</p>

<li><a name="faq8"></a><span class="fakelink">Can synergy share the display in addition to the mouse and keyboard?</span>
<p>
    No.  Synergy is a KM solution not a KVM (keyboard, video, mouse)
    solution.  However, future versions will probably support KVM.
    Hopefully, this will make synergy suitable for managing large
    numbers of headless servers.
</p>

<li><a name="faq9"></a><span class="fakelink">Can synergy do drag and drop between computers?</span>
<p>
    No.  That's a very cool idea and it'll be explored.  However, it's
    also clearly difficult and may take a long time to implement.
</p>

<li><a name="faq10"></a><span class="fakelink">Does AltGr/Mode-Switch/ISO_Level3_Shift work?</span>
<p>
    Yes, as of 1.0.12 synergy has full support for AltGr/Mode-switch.
    That includes support for most (all?) European keyboard layouts.
    All systems should be using the same keyboard layout, though, for
    all characters to work.  (Any character missing from a client's
    layout cannot be generated by synergy.)  There is experimental
    support for ISO_Level3_Shift in 1.1.3.
</p>

<li><a name="faq11"></a><span class="fakelink">Why isn't synergy ported to platform XYZ?</span>
<p>
    Probably because the developers don't have access to platform XYZ
    and/or are unfamiliar with development on XYZ.  Also, synergy has
    inherently non-portable aspects so there's a not insignificant
    effort involved in porting.
</p>

<li><a name="faq12"></a><span class="fakelink">My client can't connect.  What's wrong?</span>
<p>
    A common mistake when starting the client is to give the wrong
    server host name.  The last synergyc command line option (Unix)
    or the "Server Host Name" edit field (Windows) should be the
    host name (or IP address) of the server <b>not</b> the client's host
    name.  If you get the error <span class="code">connection failed: cannot connect
    socket</span> followed by <span class="code">the attempt to connect was forcefully
    rejected</span> or <span class="code">connection refused</span> then the server isn't started,
    can't bind the address, or the client is connecting to the wrong
    host name/address or port.
</p>
<p>
    If the client instead says <span class="code">timed out</span> then you
    probably have a firewall on the server or a router on the network.  You
    must allow connections to the server on port 24800 (or whichever port
    you're using).  Note that OS X, Windows XP and many Unix/Linux variants
	come with a firewall preinstalled and turned on by default.
</p>

<li><a name="faq13"></a><span class="fakelink">Linking fails on Solaris.  What's wrong?</span>
<p>
	Did you add
</p>
<pre>
        <nobr>--x-includes=/usr/openwin/include --x-libraries=/usr/openwin/lib</nobr>
</pre>
<p>
    to the <span class="code">configure</span> command line?  Solaris puts
    the X11 includes and libraries in an unusual place and the above lets
    synergy find them.
</p>

<li><a name="faq14"></a><span class="fakelink">The screen saver never starts.  Why not?</span>
<p>
    If the synergy server is on X Windows then the screen saver will
    not start while the mouse is on a client screen.  This is a
    consequence of how X Windows, synergy and xscreensaver work.
</p>

<li><a name="faq15"></a><span class="fakelink">I can't switch screens anymore for no apparent reason.  Why?</span>
<p>
    This should not happen with 1.1.3 and up.  Earlier versions of
    synergy would not allow switching screens when a key was down and
    sometimes it would believe a key was down when it was not.
</p>

<li><a name="faq16"></a><span class="fakelink">I get the error 'Xlib: No protocol specified'.  Why?</span>
<p>
    You're running synergy without authorization to connect to the
    X display.  Typically the reason is running synergy as root when
    logged in as non-root.  Just run synergy as the same user that's
    logged in.
</p>

<li><a name="faq17"></a><span class="fakelink">The cursor goes to secondary screen but won't come back.  Why?</span>
<p>
    Your configuration is incorrect.  You must indicate the neighbors
    of every screen.  Just because you've configured 'Apple' to be to
    the left of 'Orange' does not mean that 'Orange' is to the right
    of 'Apple'.  You must provide both in the configuration.
</p>

<li><a name="faq18"></a><span class="fakelink">The cursor wraps from one edge of the screen to the opposite.  Why?</span>
<p>
    Because you told it to.  If you list 'Orange' to be to the left of
    'Orange' then moving the mouse off the left edge of 'Orange' will
    make it jump to the right edge.  Remove the offending line from the
    configuration if you don't want that behavior.
</p>

<li><a name="faq19"></a><span class="fakelink">How do I stop my game from minimizing when I leave the screen?</span>
<p>
    Many full screen applications, particularly games, automatically
	minimize when they're no longer the active (foreground) application
	on Microsoft Windows.  The synergy server normally becomes the foreground
	when you switch to another screen in order to more reliably capture all
	user input causing those full screen applications to minimize.  To
	prevent synergy from stealing the foreground just click "Options..."
	and check "Don't take foreground window on Windows servers."  If you
	turn this on then be aware that synergy may not function correctly when
	certain programs, particularly the command prompt, are the foreground
	when you switch to other screens.  Simply make a different program the
	foreground before switching to work around that.
