<h3>Starting synergy automatically</h3>
<p>
You can configure synergy to start automatically when the computer
starts or when you log in.  The steps to do that are different on
each platform.  Note that changing these configurations doesn't
actually start or stop synergy.  The changes take effect the next
time you start your computer or log in.
</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>
Start synergy and click the <span class="code">Configure...</span> button
by the text <span class="code">Automatic Startup</span>.  The
<span class="code">Auto Start</span> dialog will pop up.
If an error occurs then correct the problem and click
<span class="code">Configure</span> again.
</p>
<p>
On the <span class="code">Auto Start</span> dialog you'll configure
synergy to start or not start automatically when the computer starts
or when you log in.  You need Administrator access rights to start
synergy automatically when the computer starts.  The dialog will let
you know if you have sufficient permission.
</p>
<p>
If synergy is already configured to automatically start then there
will be two <span class="code">Uninstall</span> buttons, at most one
of which is enabled.  Click the enabled button, if any, to tell
synergy to not start automatically.
</p>
<p>
If synergy is not configured to start automatically then there will
be two <span class="code">Install</span> buttons.  If you have
sufficient permission to have synergy start automatically when the
computer does then the <span class="code">Install</span> button in the
<span class="code">When Computer Starts</span> box will be enabled.
Click it to have synergy start for all users when the computer starts.
In this case, synergy will be available during the login screen.
Otherwise, click the <span class="code">Install</span> button in the
<span class="code">When You Log In</span> box to have synergy
automatically start when you log in.
</p>

<h4>Unix</h4>
<p>
Synergy requires an X server.  That means a server must be
running and synergy must be authorized to connect to that server.
It's best to have the display manager start synergy.  You'll need
the necessary (probably root) permission to modify the display
manager configuration files.  If you don't have that permission
you can start synergy after logging in via the
<span class="code">.xsession</span> file.
</p>
<p>
Typically, you need to edit three script files.  The first file
will start synergy before a user logs in, the second will kill
that copy of synergy, and the third will start it again after
the user logs in.
</p>
<p>
The contents of the scripts varies greatly between systems so
there's no one definite place where you should insert your edits.
However, these scripts often exit before reaching the bottom so
put the edits near the top of the script.
</p>
<p>
The location and names of these files depend on the operating
system and display manager you're using.  A good guess for the
location is <span class="code">/etc/X11</span>.  If you use kdm
then try looking in <span class="code">/etc/kde3</span> or
<span class="code">/usr/kde/<span class="arg">version</span>/share/config</span>.
Typical file names are:
</p>
<p class="code">
<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>  <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td>xdm</td> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td>kdm</td> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td>gdm</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td> <td></td> <td>xdm/Xsetup</td> <td></td> <td>kdm/Xsetup</td> <td></td>  <td>gdm/Init/Default (*)</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td> <td></td> <td>xdm/Xstartup</td> <td></td> <td>kdm/Xstartup</td> <td></td> <td>gdm/PostLogin/Default (*)</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td> <td></td> <td>xdm/Xsession</td> <td></td> <td>kdm/Xsession</td> <td></td> <td>gdm/Sessions/Default (*, **)</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
*) The <span class="code">Default</span> file is used if no other
suitable file is found.  <span class="code">gdm</span> will try
<span class="arg">displayname</span> (e.g. <span class="code">:0</span>)
and <span class="arg">hostname</span> (e.g. <span class="code">somehost</span>),
in that order, before and instead of <span class="code">Default</span>.
<br>
**) gdm may use <span class="code">gdm/Xsession</span>,
<span class="code">xdm/Xsession</span> or
<span class="code">dm/Xsession</span> if
<span class="code">gdm/Sessions/Default</span> doesn't exist.
</p>
<p>
For a synergy client, add the following to the first file:
<span class="codeblock">
  /usr/bin/killall synergyc
  sleep 1
  /usr/bin/synergyc [&lt;options&gt;] <span class="arg">synergy-server-hostname</span>
</span>
Of course, the path to synergyc depends on where you installed it
so adjust as necessary.
</p>
<p>
Add to the second file:
<span class="codeblock">
  /usr/bin/killall synergyc
  sleep 1
</span>
</p>
<p>
And to the third file:
<span class="codeblock">
  /usr/bin/killall synergyc
  sleep 1
  /usr/bin/synergyc <span class="arg">[&lt;options&gt;]</span> <span class="arg">synergy-server-hostname</span>
</span>
Note that <a href="running.html#options"><span class="arg">&lt;options&gt;</span></a>
must not include
<span class="code">-f</span> or <span class="code">--no-daemon</span> or
the script will never exit and you won't be able to log in.
</p>
<p>
The changes are the same for the synergy server except replace
<span class="code">synergyc</span> with <span class="code">synergys</span>
and use the appropriate synergys <a href="running.html#options">command
line options</a>.  Note that the
first script is run as root so synergys will look for the configuration
file in root's home directory then in <span class="code">/etc</span>.
Make sure it exists in one of those places or use the
<span class="code">--config <span class="arg">config-pathname</span></span>
option to specify its location.
</p>
<p>
Note that some display managers (xdm and kdm, but not gdm) grab
the keyboard and do not release it until the user logs in for
security reasons.  This prevents a synergy server from sharing
the mouse and keyboard until the user logs in.  It doesn't
prevent a synergy client from synthesizing mouse and keyboard
input, though.
</p>
<p>
If you're configuring synergy to start only after you log in then edit
your <span class="code">.xsession</span> file.  Add just what you
would add to the third file above.
</p>

<h4>Mac OS X</h4>
<p>
[By Tor Slettnes]
</p>
<p>
There are three different ways to automatically start Synergy
(client or server) on Mac OS X:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
  The first method involves creating a <span class="code">StartupItem</span>
  at the system level, which is executed when the machine starts up
  or shuts down.  This script will run in the background, and
  relaunch synergy as needed.
</p>
<p>
  <dl>
 <dt><b>Pros:</b></dt>
 <dd>
 Synergy is persistent, so this allows for a multi-user
 setup and interactive logins.
 </dd>
 <dt><b>Cons:</b></dt>
 <dd>
 The synergy process does not have access to the clipboard
 of the logged-in user.
 </dd>
  </dl>
</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>
  The second method will launch Synergy from the
  <span class="code">LoginWindow</span> application, once a particular
  user has logged in.
</p>
<p>
  <dl>
 <dt><b>Pros:</b></dt>
 <dd>
 The synergy process inherits the
 <span class="code">$SECURITYSESSIONID</span> environment variable,
    and therefore copy/paste works.
 </dd>
 <dt><b>Cons:</b></dt>
 <dd>
 Once the user logs out, synergy dies, and no remote
 control is possible.
 </dd>
  </dl>
</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>
  The third method is to launch a startup script from the
  "Startup Items" tab under System Preferences -> Accounts.
</p>
<p>
  <dl>
 <dt><b>Pros:</b></dt>
 <dd>
 Does not require root (Administrator) access
 </dd>
 <dt><b>Cons:</b></dt>
 <dd>
 Once the user logs out, synergy dies, and no remote
 control is possible.
 </dd>
  </dl>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The text below describes how to implement a Synergy client using
the first two methods simultaneously.  This way, Synergy is
always running, and the clipboard is available when someone is
logged in.  A Mac OS X Synergy server setup will be quite similar. 
</p>
<p>
<b>1. Create a System Level Startup Item</b>
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
  Open a <span class="code">Terminal</span> window, and become root:
  <span class="userinput">
  $ sudo su -
  </span>
</li>
<li>
  Create a folder for this item:
  <span class="userinput">
  # mkdir -p /Library/StartupItems/Synergy
  </span>
</li>
<li>
  In this folder, create a new script file by the same name as
  the directory itself, <span class="code">Synergy</span>.  This script
  should contain the following text:
</p>
<p>
<span class="codeblock">
#!/bin/sh
. /etc/rc.common
&nbsp;
run=(/usr/local/bin/synergyc -n $(hostname -s) -1 -f <span class="arg">synergy-server</span>)
&nbsp;
KeepAlive ()
{
    proc=${1##*/}
&nbsp;
    while [ -x "$1" ]
    do
        if ! ps axco command | grep -q "^${proc}\$"
        then
           "$@"
        fi
&nbsp;
        sleep 3
    done
}
&nbsp;
StartService ()
{
    ConsoleMessage "Starting Synergy"
    KeepAlive "${run[@]}" &
}
&nbsp;
StopService ()
{
    return 0
}
&nbsp;
RestartService ()
{
    return 0
}
&nbsp;
RunService "$1"
</span>
</p>
<p>
  However, replace <span class="arg">synergy-server</span> with the actual 
  name or IP address of your Synergy server.
</p>
<p>
  Note that this scripts takes care <em>not</em> to start
  Synergy if another instance is currently running.  This
  allows it to run in the background even when synergy is also
  started independently, e.g. from the <span class="code">LoginWindow</span>
  application as described below.
</li>
<li>
  Make this script executable:
  <span class="userinput">
  # chmod 755 /Library/StartupItems/Synergy/Synergy
  </span>
</li>
<li>
  In the same folder, create a file named
  <span class="code">StartupParameters.plist</span> containing:
</p>
<p>
<span class="codeblock">
{
    Description      = "Synergy Client";
    Provides         = ("Synergy");
    Requires         = ("Network");
    OrderPreference  = "None";
}
</span>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
That's it!  If you want to test this setup, you can run the
startup script as follows:
<span class="userinput">
  # /Library/StartupItems/Synergy/Synergy start
</span>
</p>
<p>
Any errors, as well as output from Synergy, will be shown in
your terminal window.
</p>
<p>
Next time you reboot, Synergy should start automatically.
</p>
<p>
<b>2. Run Synergy When a User Logs In</b>
</p>
<p>
Each time a user successfully logs in via the console, the
<span class="code">LoginWindow</span> application creates a unique session
cookie and stores it in the environment variable
<span class="code">$SECURITYSESSIONID</span>.  For copy and paste operations
to work, Synergy needs access to this environment variable.  In
other words, Synergy needs to be launched (directly or
indirectly) via the <span class="code">LoginWindow</span> application.
</p>
<p>
However, in order to kill any synergy processes started at the
system level (as described above), we need root access.  Thus,
launching Synergy within the User's environment (e.g. via the
Startup Items tab in System Preferences -> Accounts) is not an
option that work in conjunction with the method above.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, the <span class="code">LoginWindow</span> application provides
a "hook" for running a custom program (as root, with the username provided as
the first and only argument) once a user has authenticated, but
before the user is logged in.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, only one such hook is available.  If you have
already installed a Login Hook, you may need to add the text
from below to your existing script, rather than creating a new
one.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
  Launch a Terminal window, and become root:
  <span class="userinput">
  $ sudo su -
  </span>
</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>
  Find out if a LoginHook already exists:
  <span class="userinput">
  # defaults read com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook
  </span>
  This will either show the full path to a script or
  executable file, or the text:
  <span class="userinput">
  The domain/default pair of (com.apple.loginwindow, LoginHook) does not exist
  </span>
  In the former case, you need to modify your existing script,
  and/or create a "superscript" which in turn calls your
  existing script plus the one we will create here.
</p>
<p>
  The rest of this text assumes that this item did not already
  exist, and that we will create a new script.
</li>
<li>
  Create a folder in which we will store our custom startup
  script:
  <span class="userinput">
  # mkdir -p /Library/LoginWindow
  </span>
</li>
<li>
  In this folder, create a new script file (let's name it
  <span class="code">LoginHook.sh</span>), containing the following text:
</p>
<p>
<span class="codeblock">
#!/bin/sh
prog=(/usr/local/bin/synergyc -n $(hostname -s) <span class="arg">ip-address-of-server</span>)
&nbsp;
### Stop any currently running Synergy client
killall ${prog[0]##*/}
&nbsp;
### Start the new client
exec "${prog[@]}"
</span>
</li>
<li>
  Make this script executable:
  <span class="userinput">
  # chmod 755 /Library/LoginWindow/LoginHook.sh
  </span>
</li>
<li>
  Create a login hook to call the script you just created:
  <span class="userinput">
  # defaults&nbsp;write&nbsp;com.apple.loginwindow&nbsp;LoginHook&nbsp;/Library/LoginWindow/LoginHook.sh
  </span>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
More information on setting up login hooks can be found at
<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301446">Apple</a>.
</p>
<p>
When running the Synergy client, you may need to use the IP
address of the Synergy server rather than its host name.
Specifically, unless you have listed the server in your
local <span class="code">/etc/hosts</span> file or in your local NetInfo
database, name services (i.e. DNS) may not yet be available by the
time you log in after power-up.  <span class="code">synergyc</span> will
quit if it cannot resolve the server name.
</p>
<p>
(This is not an issue with the previous method, because the
<span class="code">StartupParameters.plist</span> file specifies that this
script should not be run until "network" is available).
</p>
<p>
<b>3. Good Luck!</b>
</p>
<p>
Remember to look in your system log on both your server and your
client(s) for clues to any problems you may have
(<span class="code">/var/log/system.log</span> on your OS X box, typically
<span class="code">/var/log/syslog</span> on Linux boxes).
