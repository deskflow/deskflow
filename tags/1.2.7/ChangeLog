Fixed hot keys on OS X when on a secondary screen.  This worked
in the original patch but broken during the modify/merge.  It
was broken because we turn off all hot key processing by the OS
while on a secondary screen.  The fix is to check on key press
and release if the key and modifier state matches a hot key.

This is known to be broken on hot key release if you press the
hot key then change the modifiers before releasing the provoking
key.

Checkpointing keyboard handling refactoring.  This is a major change
to the client side handling of key events.  This change converts the
X11 and win32 handling but not the OS X handling.

The new class CKeyMap contains the information necessary to convert
a synergy key event to the platform events necessary to synthesize
the key.  Platforms fill in a CKeyMap whenever their keyboard layouts
change using the addKeyEntry(), calling it once for each unique way
to synthesize a particular KeyID on the keyboard.  The CKeyMap takes
it from there, first adding dead-key combinations and some other keys,
then doing the translation from KeyID to platform keystroke sequences.
Platforms no longer need to implement the KeyID to keystroke sequence
conversion, simplifying the platform implementations.

This change also supports multiple keyboard layouts, typically used
to support various languages.  If a key is not available on the active
layout but is on a different installed layout then synergy will switch
layouts automatically.

The X11 version now fully supports the XKB extension.  This should fix
problems with Mode_switch vs ISO_Level3_Shift.  Non-XKB support is
incomplete in this checkpoint.

Fixed several win32 bugs.  Removed the 'Save' button from the
launcher;  configuration is now saved transparently.  Autostart
configuration is now saved transparently whenever it changes
and autostart is enabled.  Configuration is now saved when the
debug logging level changes.

Now releasing synthetically pressed keys when leaving the client.
The existing code was checking for key down using a local key
button id then trying to release it using the same id as a server
key button id.

Now looking up a local button id for key events that have a scan
code of 0.  These are sent by some programs that synthesize events.

Now periodically reinstalling the clipboard chain viewer.  It appears
that the chain is breaking sometimes (probably due a badly behaved
or killed app) but there's no way to detect that so this is a
workaround.

Now stopping and deleting the autostart services during uninstall.

Fixed scroll-lock screen locking on linux servers.  An earlier
change made the function that returns modifier state return the
shadowed state not the current state.  On X windows we don't
shadow the state when on the primary screen so the synergy server
would never see the scroll-lock state turned on until it left the
primary screen.  As a result scroll-lock would not lock to the
primary screen but would lock you to whatever secondary screen
you ended up on.

Changed win32 and OSX versions to work like the linux version.
Win32 used to work anyway because we constantly shadow keyboard
state on that.  OSX did not query current keyboard state at all
before and it still doesn't;  this needs to be fixed.

Now disabling the win32 foreground window on the server when
leaving the server screen.  This prevents the system from
messing up keyboard events.  The console (command prompt) and
remote desktop are known to interfere with the shift key when
they have the focus.  This introduces a bug where the window
that was the foreground is raised to the top of the stacking
order when the cursor enters the server screen.  This should
only be a problem for Mouse-X (activation follows mouse) users.
I don't know how Mouse-X changes the foreground/active window

captures global hot keys (cmd+tab, F9, etc.) and sends them
to the client.  Changes mostly due to lorenz schori.  Some
bug fixes (in lorenz's code and in synergy) and integration
into automake by crs (had to add support for Objective C++
files) and the XCode project.

This change also adds flags to events.  Flags can cause events
to be dispatched immediately and to not free event data.  Both
features are used in the new code.

This change adds events on IScreen for notification of the
system going to sleep or waking up (or the user's session
being somehow suspended and restored).  CClient and synergys
now listen for and respond to these events.  CMSWindowsScreen
used to use IJobs for handling these events synchronously.  It
now uses the new IScreen events and delivers them immediately.

lib/platform/COSXKeyState.cpp

Fixed bug in handling modifier keys on OS X clients.  Was applying
modifiers to modifiers yielding, for example:  ctrl down, ctrl down,
ctrl up for press of the control key.  The first down and the up were
there because we were applying the control modifier to the control
key.

----------
2005/01/26 18:41:28 crs
lib/platform/CXWindowsKeyState.cpp

Fixed handling of ISO_Level3_Shift.  We now prefer ISO_Level3_Shift
over Mode_switch if it's mapped to any key.  ISO_Level3_Shift
replaces Mode_switch in newer versions of X and Mode_switch does
nothing, so we have to use ISO_Level3_Shift if it's there.

----------

Adapted and applied patch by Brent Priddy for re-resolving the server
hostname on each connection.  This allows the client to startup
without being able to resolve the server's hostname.  It also lets
it handle changes in the server's address, a typical scenario when
the client is a laptop moving between networks.

----------
2004/11/11 19:23:14 crs
lib/arch/CArchMultithreadPosix.cpp

Fixed a serious flaw in wrapper for posix condition variable wait
function.  Because synergy doesn't use posix cancellation, it
cannot wake up a thread waiting on a condition variable.  So
the wrapper would wake up periodically to test if the thread was
cancelled (according to synergy's cancellation state) then go
back to waiting.  Well the condition could be signalled while
we're testing and be lost and we'd never return from the wait.
So now we wake up after a maximum timeout and return to the
caller.  The caller must check for this spurious wakeup but all
callers should do this anyway so we're okay there.

----------
2004/11/11 19:17:03 crs
lib/net/CSocketMultiplexer.cpp
lib/net/CSocketMultiplexer.h

Changed scheme used to lock the socket multiplexer's job list.
I think the new scheme is easier to understand.  It should have
exactly the same behavior.

----------
2004/11/10 21:00:30 crs
lib/mt/CCondVar.h

Made condition variable data volatile.  This will hopefully fix
an strange deadlock seen on OSX.  The CSocketMultiplexer deadlocks
with two threads, one waiting for m_polling to become false and
the other waiting for m_pollable to become true.  The weird part
is that they're both false so the first thread should proceed.
It either didn't receive the broadcast when m_polling went to
false or it's not really checking the actual value of that flag.
I can't see how the former is possible and this change fixes the
latter.

----------
2004/10/30 16:41:36 crs
lib/platform/CXWindowsKeyState.cpp

Changed X11 key mapping to fallback to the modifier keysym with
the opposite handedness if the desired handedness is missing.
For example, if Alt_R is unmapped as it often is on keyboards
with Mode_switch, the client will use Alt_L if it is mapped
when told to synthesize Alt_R.  This should fix handling of
AltGr sent from a win32 server.  AltGr is literally just
Control_L and Alt_R and, previously, an X11 client without
Alt_R mapped would only simulate Control_L.  This does not
address the fact that the user may really just want the Alt
modifier;  there are already hueristics to attempt to figure
that out.

Fixed bug in mouse wheel handling.  Was reacting with mouse wheel

doesn't use old style mouse wheel events.  Some programs (especially
the flash plugin) would send events with message == 0 causing
undesired wheel scrolling.

Fixed problem with multimonitor on OS X.  The bug was simply that
the cursor wasn't being parked in the center of the main screen

window that covers the main screen and prevent synergy from capturing
mouse motion.

Fixed compile on gcc 3.4 and later.  gcc started doing access checks
for class visibility on pointers to member function 'using the
qualifying scope of the name itself.'  what this means is if method

ctrl, alt, or AltGr to clients.

lib/platform/CMSWindowsScreenSaver.cpp

----------
2004/07/29 21:53:30 crs
lib/platform/CMSWindowsKeyState.cpp

Worked around bogus key mapping on 95/98/me where multiple virtual
keys are mapped to the same button.  For example, the backslash
virtual key shares a button with some other virtual key on british
english key mappings.  Synergy could end up using the wrong virtual
key.  In the given case, the other virtual key produced no character
at all.  To determine which virtual key should really be mapped to
a button we map the button back to a virtual key and see if it's the
virtual key we started with.

Also fixed mapping of pause key.  Previously, windows+pause sent to
a win32 client wouldn't bring up system properties like it should.

----------
2004/07/29 21:50:17 crs
lib/platform/CMSWindowsDesks.cpp

Synergy now steals window activation when using low level hooks
and a console window is the active window.  This is to work around
console windows preventing the hook from detecting the shift key.

----------
2004/07/29 21:48:40 crs
lib/net/CTCPSocket.cpp

Worked around bug/weirdness on OS X.  It's reporting that a
non-blocking connect is available for writing (i.e. the connection
was successful) when the connection has actually failed.  This
caused synergy to rapidly retry connecting.  This change makes
synergy check for a connection error whether one was reported or
not.  Thankfully, OS X does correctly set the socket error state
when it bogusly reports a successful connection so we can tell the
connection failed.

----------
2004/07/28 21:54:39 crs
lib/net/CTCPSocket.cpp

Added workaround for apparent bug in OS X 10.3.4.  If you started
a synergy client on that OS and pointed it at a system that wasn't
listening for connections then instead of the connection attempt
failing with 'connection refused' the system would claim the
connection succeeded.  A subsequent read would reveal the problem
and synergy would "disconnect" and retry, causing the CPU to spin.
The system does correctly set the socket error state so this
workaround checks for socket errors when connecting whether or not
select reports an error state.

Also, sometimes the system doesn't claim success but doesn't report
an error.  Synergy eventually times out these attempts.

----------

2004/06/22 21:11:14 crs
lib/platform/CXWindowsScreen.cpp

Disable key event capture on X11.  This was going to be used to
detect synergy hotkeys but a design flaw in X11 makes it problematic
with many applications.  We'll have to fall back to the more
traditional XGrabKey when the time comes.

----------

lib/arch/CMultibyte.cpp

lib/client/CClient.cpp

Fixed assertion failure when client connection fails immediately.

----------
2004/06/10 19:56:35 crs
lib/arch/CArchNetworkBSD.cpp

Changed O_NDELAY to O_NONBLOCK.  On some versions of Unix, read
return 0 when O_NDELAY is set and there is nothing to read.  We
want the O_NONBLOCK behavior where read returns -1 and sets
errno to EAGAIN when there is nothing to read.

----------
2004/06/10 19:42:01 crs
lib/common/Makefile.am

Added OS X precompiled header file for XCode compiles.

----------
2004/06/10 19:39:07 crs
cmd/launcher/CAutoStart.cpp

Removed dependency of service on Browser.  Browser isn't always
available and, if it's not, synergy won't start.  Users may have
to use an IP server address instead of a hostname since the
service may start before the service that resolves hostnames.
If I knew what that service was I'd depend on it instead.

----------

----------
2004/06/07 21:06:49 crs

Failed to reset flag in X11 event queue buffer and that could cause

----------
2004/05/18 20:32:13 crs
lib/platform/CMSWindowsScreen.cpp

If the server manages to detect ctrl+alt+del it will no longer send
that to the client.  If it did then the user could see the effect of
ctrl+alt+del on both the server and client which we never want.  The
user can use ctrl+alt+pause to emulate ctrl+alt+del on the client.

----------
2004/05/18 20:26:48 crs
lib/platform/CXWindowsEventQueueBuffer.cpp
lib/platform/CXWindowsEventQueueBuffer.h

Fixed bug that could allow multiple threads to simultaneously access
the X11 display connection.  The only problematic method was
CXWindowsEventQueueBuffer::addEvent given that the other event queue
methods are only called from the main thread.

----------
2004/05/17 21:55:55 crs

Fixed ctrl+alt+del emulation on win32 server.  It was mapping

Used MouseKeys accessibility function to show the mouse cursor

Added support for a global relative mouse motion option.  When true
and on a secondary screen and locked to the screen (via scroll lock)
mouse motion is sent as motion deltas.  When true and scroll lock
is toggled off the mouse is warped to the secondary screen's center
so the server knows where it is.  This option is intended to support
games and other programs that repeatedly warp the mouse to the center
of the screen.  This change adds general and X11 support but not
win32.  The option name is "relativeMouseMoves".

Removed use of mbrtowc, wcrtomb, and mbsinit.  Many platforms
didn't support them and the emulated versions were just as good
except for a performance problem with excessive locking and
unlocking of a mutex.  So this also changes IArchString to
provide string rather than character conversion so we can lock
the mutex once per string rather than once per character.

Updates to support OS X.  This improves support for building on
multiple systems with automake, with X Windows and Carbon window
system APIs supported.  It's also a starting port for supporting
win32 builds using mingw.  OS X support is incomplete;  the tree
will compile and link but the binaries will not function.

Fixed bug in handling rejection of screen with name that's already

connected client was being forcefully disconnected too because the
client to disconnect was found by looking up the client by name.
We now instead look up the client by IClient*.

Added workaround for win32 low-level mouse hook position weirdness.
The low-level hook can report mouse positions outside the boundaries

Converted win32 to new keyboard state tracking design.  Also
changed locking to screen so that keys no longer count (only
mouse buttons and scroll lock toggled on).  This is to deal
with the unreliability of key event reporting which can leave
us locked to a screen with no key physically pressed.  The
result of this is that clients get key repeats and releases
without the corresponding key press.  CKeyState handles this
by discarding repeat/release events on keys it hasn't seen go
down.  Also made a few other minor fixes to win32 keyboard
handling.

Checkpoint.  Converted X11 to new keyboard state tracking design.
This new design is simpler.  For keyboard support, clients need only
implement 4 virtual methods on a class derived from CKeyState and
one trivial method in the class derived from CPlatformScreen, which
is now the superclass of platform screens instead of IPlatformScreen.
Keyboard methods have been removed from IPlatformScreen, IPrimaryScreen
and ISecondaryScreen.  Also, all keyboard state tracking is now in
exactly one place (the CKeyState subclass) rather than in CScreen,
the platform screen, and the key mapper.  Still need to convert Win32.

Changed how key state is tracked on X11.  Now updating key state
on every key press and release so we don't have to updateKeys()
in isLockedToScreen().  However, if any key appears to be down
we still call updateKeys() to double check that it's really down.
If not we note the spurious lock and don't lock to the screen.

Improved handling of active window on win32.  Synergy no longer
takes activation so the previously active window doesn't pop to
the top of the window stack when it regains activation.  One
drawback of this is that the mouse cursor isn't shown when
a window (other than synergy's) is activated.  However, synergy
does detect mouse motion as before and shows the cursor when it
sees any.

so the display would power down normally on a synergy client if
there was no input activity.

Win32 fixes.  Fixed slightly off cursor positioning when using
absolute mouse_event().  Improved keyboard handling:  now using
keyboard layout of last foreground window when leaving server
so users can meaningfully choose the locale, moved dead key
handling into hook library so there should be no more race
conditions involving the keyboard dead key buffer, simplified
keyboard and cursor handling by using a full screen transparent
window when not using low level hooks, fixed error in restoring
buffered dead key when checking for dead keys.  This hopefully
fixes all known keyboard bugs on win32.

Fixed BSD unblockPollSocket().  Was signaling to break out of
poll() but there was a race condition where the thread trying
to unblock poll() could send the signal before the polling
thread had entered poll().  Now using a pipe and polling on
that and the client's sockets, and just writing a byte into
the pipe to unblock poll.  This persists until the next call
to poll() so we might force poll() to return once unnecessarily
but that's not a problem.  This change makes the BSD code
similar to the winsock code, which uses a winsock event instead
of a pipe.

previous the key was discarded.  Fixed that but VkKeyScan() fails
in this case so added special case to fix that (assuming AltGr is
required).  VkKeyScan() can return the wrong result for characters

Now warping mouse to center of screen when leaving client screens.
Some users requested this.  Also, the hider window is mapped before
warping the mouse so the active window shouldn't change if the focus
policy is point-to-focus.  Showing the window first can also reduce
the likelihood of seeing the cursor briefly in its hidden position.

Now turning off auto-repeat when on an X11 client.  This prevents
the server from auto-repeating fake events, which is undesired
since synergy will do the auto-repeating itself.  This also
disables auto-repeat on any keys locally configured on X11 to not
auto-repeat.  That's mainly to suppress auto-repeat on modifier
keys, which auto-repeat on win32 but not X11.

lib/platform/CMSWindowsPrimaryScreen.cpp
lib/platform/CMSWindowsPrimaryScreen.h

lib/platform/CSynergyHook.h

Fixed a few win32 keyboard/mouse problems.  First, the mouse hook
now captures non-client area mouse messages.  Previously, these
were ignored (because i forgot about them) and they caused all
kinds of problems because they weren't forwarded.  For example,
clicking on a window border would cause the window to start
resizing when the mouse came back to the server screen.  Moving
inside a title bar meant that the mouse wouldn't move on the
client screen.

Second, because non-client messages are now handled, the full
screen transparent window is no longer necessary to capture
input so it's never displayed.  (The window is still necessary
for clipboard ownership so it's still created.)  No transparent
window means no screen flashing.  It also means we don't have to
become the foreground and active window.  This plays better with
apps that minimize or restore when they're no longer the
foreground application/active window.

Third, fixed the low level keyboard hook to forward toggle key
updates, which it was neglecting to do.

Finally, keyboard and mouse input is always forwarded from the hook
to the primary screen handler which then shadows the current key
and mouse button state.  If we're using low level hooks then this
isn't really necessary and GetKeyState() always returns the right
info but without low level hooks it means we can just use the
shadow state.  It also means we don't have to show our window in
order to get the system's key state table up to date, fixing the
screen flash when checking for the scroll lock state.

Boosted priority of main synergy threads to be very high (highest
realtime priority).  After some testing it appears that anything
less than this can starve synergy in some circumstances, preventing
it from forwarding messages to clients.  This is a rather risky
change since synergy can now virtually take over a system if it
behaves badly.  This change only affects windows systems since
lib/arch of other platforms don't yet attempt to boost priority.

Removed periodic call to XForceScreenSaver() to prevent the built-in
screen saver from activating.  It was unnecessary since the built-in
screen saver is disabled as appropriate;  this call was just to
ensure that the screen saver wouldn't start if an external program
reactivated the screen saver after synergy disabled it.

It's possible that this was causing screen flicker under gnome, though
i don't know why.  It's also possible that periodically sending events
to xscreensaver is causing the flicker but removing that code is more
difficult because xscreensaver can't be disabled, only deactivated or
killed.

Fixed several win32 bugs.  First, synergy wasn't forwarding mouse
events to other hook functions, which broke some tools like objectbar.
Second, windows key processing was fixed.  Previously pressing and
release the key would only send a press event, locking the user onto
the client window;  also, the win32 server treated as a Meta modifier
instead of a Super modifier, which broke any use of it as any kind of
modifier key.  Third, added hacks to support several key combinations
on windows 95/98/me that are treated specially by windows, including
Alt+Tab, Alt+Shift+Tab, Alt+Esc, Alt+Shift+Esc, Ctrl+Esc, and any
combination using the windows key like Win+E and Win+F but not
Ctrl+Alt+Del.  Fourth, scroll lock only locking to the client (which
only happened when using a synergy server on windows) has been fixed;
unfortunately the solution causes a lot of screen redraws for some
reason.  Finally, there's been a fix to clipboard handling that may
or may not fix a problem where the clipboard would stop transferring
between systems after a little while.  I can't be sure if it fixes
the problem because I can't reproduce the problem.

Fixed lookup of neighbor screens.  The first problem was an old

that the mouse position was really on the screen if the neighbor
screen wasn't connected.

After that was fixed there was another problem when one screen
linked to another which then linked (in the same direction) to
itself.  If the latter screen wasn't connected then it'd get into
an infinite loop.

lib/platform/CXWindowsScreenSaver.cpp
lib/platform/CXWindowsScreenSaver.h

Synergy no longer tries to suppress the screen saver once it starts.
It was doing that already if started through synergy but not if
started by something outside of synergy.  In particular, if you
use `xscreensaver-command --activate' synergy used to send fake
mouse motion events every 5 seconds to deactivate it.  That's
unlikely to be what the user wanted, especially if the locking is
enabled since it would force the password dialog to appear.

As before, it's recommended that client screens not use locking
because xscreensaver will not deactivate without getting a
password even if we make the request through a programmatic
interface.  Presumably that's for security reasons but it makes
life harder for synergy.

lib/platform/CMSWindowsPrimaryScreen.cpp
lib/platform/CMSWindowsSecondaryScreen.cpp

Attempt to fix problems with multimon windows.  The mouse position
reported by the synergy hook dll is in a space with 0,0 in the
upper-left which is not necessarily the same as the virtual desktop
space.  So the windows primary screen now accounts for that.  On
the secondary screen, mouse_event() doesn't seem to accept negative
coordinates even on the windows NT family, making monitors with
negative coordinates inaccessible via absolute moves.  So if the
move will be to negative coordinates, use the windows 95 family
fallback of absolute moving to 0,0 then relative moving to the
final position.

Refactored some platform dependent code into a new library,
lib/arch.  This should make porting easier.  Will probably
continue to refactor a little more, moving platform dependent
event handling stuff into lib/platform.

Now ignoring half-duplex keys that are down when deciding if
the mouse is locked to the screen.  We can't tell if a half-
duplex key is physically down and logically down just means
it's active so there's no point in letting it lock the mouse
to the screen.

Now restoring toggle key states on leaving a client screen to

leaving a client screen the toggle keys kept their state so,

lib/server/CMSWindowsPrimaryScreen.cpp

Fixed loss of ctrl+alt when transmitted to non-windows platforms
from a windows server.  Was converting ctrl+alt on windows to
mode switch on the server.  No longer doing that;  windows clients
will interpret ctrl+alt as AltGr and other clients will just see
ctrl+alt.  Also made the right alt key mode switch on windows
servers in case the user wants to force a mode switch, but that
means the right alt key no longer acts as alt on clients.

2002/08/18 17:40:10 crs
lib/server/CMSWindowsPrimaryScreen.cpp

fixed win32 deadlock.  when a client disconnects the server will
warp the mouse to the primary screen.  entering the primary
screen causes the primary screen's window to be hidden.  the
deadlock occurs because hiding the window seems to post a
message then wait for it to be handled (or possibly it won't
send a message while a posted message is being handled).
thread A locks the mutex, warps the mouse, the hides the window.
thread B begins processing the mouse warp then tries to lock
the mutex.  thread A is waiting on the event loop owned by B
while B is waiting on the mutex owned by A.  this fix simply
hides the window asynchronously.  however, there may be other
ways to cause a similar deadlock that have not been found.

Moved version header to base and it now uses VERSION macro
from config.h if available (which means version is now a

protocol version to 1.0.  And added MAINTAINERCLEANFILES
to makefiles to remove generated files.

Reorganized source tree.  Moved client.cpp into cmd/synergy as
synergy.cpp and server.cpp into cmd/synergyd as synergyd.cpp.
Moved and renamed related files.  Moved remaining source files
into lib/....  Modified and added makefiles as appropriate.
Result is that library files are under lib with each library
in its own directory and program files are under cmd with each
command in its own directory.

is likely to be started by xdm or the user's xsession, it's
better for synergy to simply terminate when the connection

checkpoint.  still refactoring.  merged common code from primary
screens into CPrimaryScreen and merged common code from secondary
screens into CSecondaryScreen.  changed is-a relationship to a
has-a between the primary and secondary screen classes and the
generic platform dependent screen class to avoid multiple
inheritance of implementation.  also standardized the interface
for those generic screen classes.  adding a platform now involves
implementing simpler interfaces:  IScreen for the generic screen,
IScreenEventHandler and some methods of CPrimaryScreen for the
primary screen, and IScreenEventHandler and some methods of
CSecondaryScreen for the secondary screen.  did X11 platform
but not win32 platform.

updated to new automake and refactored server stuff.  the server
now speaks to the primary screen and secondary screens almost
everywhere the same way through an IClient interface;  only
special primary screen calls are accessed through a different
interface, the CPrimaryClient interface.  this simplifies the
server since it no longer needs to test whether the active screen
is the primary or a secondary in most cases.

the server no longer speaks directly to the primary screen;  all
that goes through the CPrimaryClient, which often just forwards
the call.  the primary screen no longer speaks directly to the
server either, again going through the CPrimaryClient via a
IPrimaryReceiver interface.

CServerProtocol classes have been replaced by CClientProxy
classes which are very similar.  the name makes more sense
though.

can disconnect clients that are dead but never reset the TCP

CXWindowsUtil::CErrorLock wasn't XSync()'ing the display before
installing and uninstalling the new error handler, causing
errors before the lock to be caught and errors during the lock
to not be caught.  had to add Display* as argument to c'tor.

some cleanup.  also fixed a race condition when adding threads

parent now does the adding and removing.

----------
2002/06/20 16:27:49 crs
platform/CXWindowsClipboard.cpp
platform/CXWindowsClipboard.h

fixed bug introduced by previous checkin.  calling XCheckIfEvent()
multiple times is *not* the same as calling XIfEvent() because the
former will re-encounter events that it didn't process previously.
to make things simple it now pulls events off the queue and saves
them if not processed for selection transfer and puts them back
afterwards.

----------
2002/06/20 14:01:44 crs
platform/CXWindowsClipboard.cpp

speeded up clipboard transfer by avoiding a selection request
when it wasn't necessary.  (in particular, we were getting the
clipboard update time from the owner then emptying the clipboard,
so we didn't need to get the time.  worse, most owners don't
support getting the time and we often timed out.)

also fixed a multithread bug using the X display.  we were using
a CThread to send an event after a timeout while we were waiting
in XIfEvent().  this necessarily involved two threads calling
into Xlib at once, which is not allowed.  now using polling to
do the timeout because Xlib doesn't have a function to get
events with a timeout.

fixed bugs in mouse motion.  wasn't taking care to capture all
motion events relative to the previous mouse position.  for
example, if two mouse events arrive, the first at x+1,y and
the second at x+2,y, we used to compute deltas of 1,0 and 2,0
instead of 1,0 and 1,0.  that's fixed.  also worked around a
bug (probably) in windows that caused a motion event after a
SetCursorPos() to be lost or reported one pixel off from the
correct position.  now using mouse_event() which doesn't
have that problem.  also fixed calculation of normalized
coordinates for mouse_event() when there are multiple
displays.

fixed problem with setConfig().  if the new config didn't
include a screen that was already connected under an alias
then that screen wouldn't be disconnected and removed from
the screen list until the screen voluntarily disconnected.
at that time removeConnection() would assert because the
screen name would not be found.  now using the canonical
name in the protocol object as well as CServer.  this
allows setConfig() to always detect removed screens and
disconnect them.

changes to add command line arguments.  also added automatic
restarting and daemonizing on unix.  daemon sends log messages
to syslog.  unix now reads config file from file named on
command line;  if no command line arg then uses effective
user's config file and if that's not there it finally tries
/etc/synergy.conf.  if there are no screens configured then
one is added for the primary screen.  broke some startup
stuff on win32.

also now timing out if X primary screen can't grab the mouse
and keyboard.  the server will just give up trying to switch
screens.  the grabs will fail is some other app has a grab
and won't release it.  note that kdm grabs the keyboard for
the duration that the login window is displayed, effectively
disabling synergy.

added better handling of X server disconnecting unexpectedly.
the apps still exit but they do it in a mostly controlled
manner.  in particular, the server threads except the one
processing primary screen events will terminate gracefully.
this will be important should the server ever allow HTTP
clients to rewrite the configuration file.

note that X makes it effectively impossible to continue once
the X server disconnects.  even if it didn't it would be
difficult for synergy to recover.  users will have to add
synergy to the X display manager's startup script if they
expect the server to be restarted.  alternatively, we could
add code to fork synergy at startup;  the child would do
the normal work while the parent would simply wait for the
child to exit and restart it.

fixes, mainly for windows.  first, had to add a notification from
CServer to the primary screen when the configuration changes so it
can make necessary adjustments (the win32 primary screen must tell
the hook dll about the new jump zones).

changed includes of some std c++ library files to go through
our own include files.  these wrap the include with stuff to
keep vc++ quiet when compiling at warning level 4, which is
what it does now.  it also works around missing <istream> and
<ostream> on g++2.96.

added missing std:: where necessary.  g++ doesn't really support
namespaces so it lets references without the namespace slip
through.

added workaround or fix.  not sure if istringstream::str(string)
should reset eofbit.  it does on g++ but does not on vc++.
added clear() after str() so it works either way.

added low-level keyboard hook to win32.  if available (it's only
available on NT SP3 and up) it allows us to catch and handle
alt+tab, alt+esc, ctrl+esc, and windows key hot keys.  i think
that leaves only ctrl+alt+del and accessibility functions
uncaught on those systems.

fixed two blown assertions.  first, if user tried to switch to
a client that had connected but hadn't yet sent the first info
message it would assert on the zero size screen.  second, if
the primary screen was handling a mouse motion on behalf of a
secondary screen when that secondary screen disconnected then
an assert would blow because the primary screen would call
onMouseMoveSecondary() but m_protocol on the active screen is
NULL because disconnecting the active secondary screen caused
the mouse to jump to the primary screen.

CXWindowsScreen.  changed how requests are processed into a
hopefully easier to understand model.  added support for getting
clipboard from and sending clipboard to motif (or at least

checkpoint.  changed protocol to better handle clipboards.  now
sending a sequence number with enter messages.  screens use that
sequence number in clipboard grab and data messages.  the server
uses the sequence number to order messages across clients.  also
changed secondary screens to send clipboard updates on leaving
(or when grab occurs when not active) instead of on a query from
the server.  primary effectively does the same.  the query
message has been removed.

updated

----------
2002/04/26 20:14:46 crs
client/CXWindowsSecondaryScreen.cpp

Fixed caps-lock and num-lock behavior.  It seems to work okay
now but did notice one problem:  when powerbook is primary and
num-lock is on the keypad works fine until shift is pressed
(and released);  after that the keypad only works while the
shift key is down.

----------
2002/04/26 20:12:55 crs
server/CXWindowsPrimaryScreen.cpp
server/CXWindowsPrimaryScreen.h

Added hack to handle "half-duplex" caps-lock key on powerbook.
That key only reports press when pressed and released when
caps-lock is activated and only reports release when pressed
and released when caps-lock is deactivated.  I don't know of a
way to detect this behavior so it may have to be configured by
the user.  The code assumes normal behavior;  will have to add
code to set the flag (perhaps from a user configuration).

checkpoint.  improvements to clipboard transfer on X windows.
not detecting a change to clipboard when synergy window isn't
the owner (since there's no event for this;  we'll have to
check when we leave the screen i guess).  large transfers

initial revision of synergy.  currently semi-supports X windows
on unix, but client screens don't simulate events other than
mouse move.  also not supporting clipboard at all yet and the
main app is just a temporary framework to test with.  must
clean up protocol and communication.
