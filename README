Announcement | 2009-08-04
=========================
We have recently switched to CMake, to replace Automake.
Plese read the Compiling wiki page for help with CMake:
http://synergy-foss.org/pm/projects/synergy/wiki/Compiling

Linux/Mac
---------
Instead of using the traditional GNU style `./configure; make`
commands, you will now need to use CMake.

Windows
-------
Instead of using the VS2005 and VS2008 directories, you now need
to generate the Visual Studio project files using CMake.
