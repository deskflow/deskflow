Mac OS X Readme
===============

To install on Mac OS X with the .zip distribution (first seen in 1.3.6) you must follow these steps:

  1. Extract the zip file to any location (usually double click will do this)
  2. Open Terminal, and cd to the extracted directory (e.g. /Users/my-name/Downloads/extracted-dir/)
  3. Change to super user (use the su command)
  4. Copy the binaries to /usr/bin using: cp synergy* /usr/bin

How to enable the root user in Mac OS X:

Once the binaries have been copied to /usr/bin, you should follow the configuration guide:
