\def LOG(arg)
Write to the log.  Because macros cannot accept variable arguments, this
should be invoked like so:
\code
LOG((CLOG_XXX "%d and %d are %s", x, y, x == y ? "equal" : "not equal"));
\endcode
In particular, notice the double open and close parentheses.  Also note
that there is no comma after the \c CLOG_XXX.  The \c XXX should be
replaced by one of enumerants in \c Log::ELevel without the leading
\c k.  For example, \c CLOG_INFO.  The special \c CLOG_PRINT level will
not be filtered and is never prefixed by the filename and line number.

If \c NOLOGGING is defined during the build then this macro expands to
nothing.  If \c NDEBUG is defined during the build then it expands to a
call to Log::print.  Otherwise it expands to a call to Log::print,
which includes the filename and line number.
*/

/*!
\def LOGC(expr, arg)
Write to the log if and only if expr is true.  Because macros cannot accept
variable arguments, this should be invoked like so:
\code
LOGC(x == y, (CLOG_XXX "%d and %d are equal", x, y));
\endcode
In particular, notice the parentheses around everything after the boolean
expression.    Also note that there is no comma after the \c CLOG_XXX.
The \c XXX should be replaced by one of enumerants in \c Log::ELevel
without the leading \c k.  For example, \c CLOG_INFO.  The special
\c CLOG_PRINT level will not be filtered and is never prefixed by the
filename and line number.

If \c NOLOGGING is defined during the build then this macro expands to
nothing.  If \c NDEBUG is not defined during the build then it expands
to a call to Log::print that prints the filename and line number,
otherwise it expands to a call that doesn't.
