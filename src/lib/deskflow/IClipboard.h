  Platform dependent clipboard subclasses can and should present any
  suitable formats derivable from these formats.

  \c kText is a text format encoded in UTF-8.  Newlines are LF (not
  CR or LF/CR).

  \c kBitmap is an image format.  The data is a BMP file without the
  14 byte header (i.e. starting at the INFOHEADER) and with the image
  data immediately following the 40 byte INFOHEADER.

  \c kHTML is a text format encoded in UTF-8 and containing a valid
  HTML fragment (but not necessarily a complete HTML document).
  Newlines are LF.
