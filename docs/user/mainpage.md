**Deskflow** is a free and open source keyboard and mouse sharing app.
Use the keyboard, mouse, or trackpad of one computer to control nearby computers,
and work seamlessly between them.
It's like a software KVM (but without the video).
TLS encryption is enabled by default. Wayland is supported. Clipboard sharing is supported.


> On Windows, you will need to install the
> [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version).  
> Download latest: [`vc_redist.x64.exe`](https://aka.ms/vc14/vc_redist.x64.exe) [`vc_redist.arm64.exe`](https://aka.ms/vc14/vc_redist.arm64.exe)

> For macOS users, the easiest way to install and stay up to date is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) with our [homebrew-tap](https://github.com/deskflow/homebrew-tap).
> macOS reports unsigned apps as damaged. This occurs because we do not use an Apple certificate for notarization. Clear the quarantine attribute to run the app: `xattr -c Deskflow.app`
