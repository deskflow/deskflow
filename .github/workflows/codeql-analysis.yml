# According to the docs, the CodeQL workflow should be triggered directly by push to master
# and by pull requests (we only run this on open PRs as it's very slow). We also use the
# `workflow_dispatch` event is also enabled to allow manual triggering of the workflow for testing.
#
# We should not trigger this workflow with `workflow_call` as this causes the error:
#   "1 configuration present on `master` was not found"
#
# Sadly, this means we can't roll it into our monolithic CI workflow.
