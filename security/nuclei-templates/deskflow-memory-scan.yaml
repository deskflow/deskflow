  name: "Deskflow Memory Exhaustion Vulnerability"
  author: Denizhan Dakılır
  severity: medium
  description: |
    A potential memory exhaustion vulnerability might exist in Deskflow versions before 1.18.
    An attacker can cause memory exhaustion in the Deskflow server component by sending
    specially crafted long TCP messages. This template attempts to test for memory
    exhaustion by sending large payloads while monitoring server response.
    
    The test includes multiple indicators to differentiate between actual memory
    exhaustion and other performance-related issues:
    - Memory-specific error messages
    - Connection reset patterns
    - Gradual performance degradation
    - System resource exhaustion signals
